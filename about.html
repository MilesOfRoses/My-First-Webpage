        <h3> About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Miles Rose! I made this portfolio website to showcase some of my favorite animation work. <br><br>
        I am a self taught learner and I have been involved with different kinds of digital media and animation for many years and expressing myself through visual digital media has become a life long passion for me. As I progressed and developed my sculpture and claymation skills, I began to expand into the world of computer animation to incorperate into my work. As I continued to explore the animation software that helped allow me to develop my digital and clay animations, I was curious about the underlying technologies and programming behind the software and how I could modify code in the software to create custom results for my animation. As I learned more about coding and programming, a whole new pandora's box was opened! I've been exploring different learning platforms online and now here I am, experimenting with HTML and CSS code on this website.</p>
